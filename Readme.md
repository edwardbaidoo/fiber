# Fiber

A project which shows what is going on and there was a lot of things happening.

Basically this is a Golang project built with the go fiber router. Which reminds me, i need to change some of my old projects from gin or mux to fiber. 

Do not take any errors you see here seriously, this is just a test. However i do take them serious and I always ensure they are a wild lesson learnt.
