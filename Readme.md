# Fiber

A project which shows what is going on and there was a lot of things happening.

Basically this is a Golang project built with the go fiber router. Which reminds me, i need to change some of my old projects from gin or mux to fiber. 

Do not take any errors you see here seriously, this is just a test. However i do take them serious and I always ensure they are a wild lesson learnt. 

## Starting the project

You know how to start a regular project. However if you are developing on this, you can use the ```AIR``` package to give you an autobuild feature after every save.
This package can be located [here on Github](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)

1. Clone the repo(This repo)
2. Initiate air ```air init```
3. Run air ```air```
